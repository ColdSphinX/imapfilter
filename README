This is my framework that I've written to use imapfilter ( https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter ).

In "options.lua" I set the known global options from imapfilter.
In addition I put some new global options for my framework there.
For example the path to the file with the encrypted passwords.


"accounts.lua" includes the login information and in which order
imapfilter has to go through all the accounts ( my.lis array ).
Also this file includes which sort() function has to be used with an account.

"sort.lua" just has the include instructions for the sort() functions in it.
I recommend to put these in "sort/${accountname}.lua".
